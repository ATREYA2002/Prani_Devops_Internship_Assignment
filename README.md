# üß© Multi-Service App with NGINX Reverse Proxy (Dockerized)

This project demonstrates a simple microservice architecture using:

- üü¶ **Golang Backend (Service 1)**
- üêç **Python/Flask Backend (Service 2)**
- üåê **NGINX as a Reverse Proxy**

All services are containerized with Docker and managed via Docker Compose. Everything is accessible on a **single port: `http://localhost:8081`** using path-based routing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Service 1** is a Golang API running on port `8001`
2. **Service 2** is a Python Flask API running on port `8002`
3. **NGINX** runs on port `80` internally, exposed to host as `8081`
4. NGINX uses path-based routing:
   - `/service1` ‚Üí forwards to service 1
   - `/service2` ‚Üí forwards to service 2

## üöÄ How to Set Up & Run

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ATREYA2002/Prani_Devops_Internship_Assignment.git
cd Prani_Devops_Internship_Assignment
````

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the System

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

> This builds and starts all services.

---

## üåê Access the Services

Once running, open your browser or use `curl`:

| Endpoint                               | Description           |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `http://localhost:8081/service1/ping`  | Health check (Go)     |
| `http://localhost:8081/service1/hello` | Hello from Go         |
| `http://localhost:8081/service2/ping`  | Health check (Python) |
| `http://localhost:8081/service2/hello` | Hello from Python     |

## üìù What I Did

1. **Created Dockerfiles** for:

   * Golang service exposing port `8001`
   * Python Flask service exposing port `8002`
   * NGINX with custom routing config

2. **Configured `nginx.conf`** to:

   * Reverse proxy to both services
   * Log request time, path, and client IP

3. **Used Docker Compose** to:

   * Build and run the full system using a single command

## üìä Logs & Monitoring

To view NGINX access logs:

```bash
docker logs nginx
```

This logs requests with IP, timestamp, and request path for observability.
